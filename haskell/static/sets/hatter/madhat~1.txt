Okay, I was kinda nervous about this doll. I've made nothing like her
before, so if you are in any way deeply offended, I am truly sorry.
Please don't flame me! Mad Hatter is an experiment with a different
type of doll.

Mad Hatter is from the mange Angel Sanctuary by Kaori Yuki; you can
search online for information.

The body: Everything except the eyes, part of the lips, and jawline are
made by me. The arm was done from scratch. The body was taken from my 
Nanaka Nakatomi fanart (from Mahou Tsukai Tai). I made the hair up from
looking at various pictures. So, this means YOU CANNOT HAVE THIS BASE
DOLL (or anything directly from this set). :P

Set 0: the striped outfit she wears (my mom calls it the Betelgeuse suit) [everyone knows who Betelgeuse/Beetlejuice is right?]
Set 1: the scary outfit she wears
Set 2: weeeird outfit she wears
Set 3: put together--she wears the dress in one picture
Set 4: scary-looking outfit
Set 5: prom maybe? she'd probably scare everyone away :P
Set 6: why do i like this outfit? i dunno
Set 7: borrowed from arashi (from x/1999)
Set 8: i also like this outfit (she looks like a shoplifter :P)
Set 9: umm... different :P

FKiSS:  Lips & eye makeup change, there's a white makeup mask she has, 
	and there's a midi in this set... yep, it's the Stone Tower 
	theme from Zelda 64: Majora's Mask. I've fallen in love with 
	Stone Tower and wish to live there. :)
