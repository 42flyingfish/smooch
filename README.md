I'm making a set of tools for viewing, converting, and creating KiSS dolls. 
KiSS stands for Kisaeke (Japanese for "dress up") Set System. KiSS dolls 
have been around for a long time, but there are no modern viewers and no 
way to play with these dolls online. Many very talented artists spent 
countless hours making these fun digital toys. Some are wonderful examples 
of pixel artistry. It would be a shame for them to be lost just because 
technology has moved on.

The first tool I'm making is cel2png. It converts the individual 
pixel art cells to png files so they can be viewed more easily and even 
used in web app projects. Big thanks to Mark Dominus who helped me with 
this during his residency at the Recurse Center.
