For example, here's something that typifies the transition that happened. In early KiSS, artists would set a "fix" value for underwear, so you could remove the underwear after clicking 20 times or something. So it turned undressing women into a game of persistence (super creepy!). That aspect faded a little bit as time went on, and underwear was just treated as yet another item to mix and match with the other clothes. But my generation of artists, we would have a little word balloon pop up if you tried to remove the underwear: the doll would yell at you to cut it out. The older KiSS artists (all genders) considered that immature and prudish, but for us, those dolls represented not some objectified anime characters, but ourselves. We objected to players making a game of removing our underwear! That tension between these adults and the invading horde of teenage girls was in hindsight really interesting.

KiSS was also where I learned some of the very basics of computer programming. Making the simplest doll required several special tools to make the image "cels" and palettes and then bundle it all up. And to make a KiSS doll that blinked or changed hair colors, you had to write in the very rudimentary FKiSS scripting language. So it taught me stuff like events and debugging. My first experiences tearing my hair out over a bug where in KiSS. :) But the community was very generous about helping even the least coherent 11-year-olds asking for help.
